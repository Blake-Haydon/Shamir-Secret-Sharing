# Shamir's Secret Sharing

Contains implementations for [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) (SSS). These notebooks are used for my own learning and are not intended to be a complete reference.

- [SSS over the reals](/secret_sharing_over_reals.ipynb): This is SSS over real numbers in order to simplify construction
- [SSS over finite fields](/secret_sharing_over_finite_fields.ipynb): This is SSS over finite fields, which is the more general case for binary data
